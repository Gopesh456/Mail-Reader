    For each email in the provided list, fetch the email body content using the bodyReaderTool.
    Analyze the content and extract key information, action items, and deadlines.

    You have the following tools available:

    1. bodyReaderTool: Use this FIRST to fetch email body content for each important email subject.

    2. ReminderTool: Set calendar reminders/alarms for time-sensitive items like quizzes, tests, or deadlines.
       - If there's a quiz on Dec 1st at 10am, set a reminder at 10am.
       - Use for any event with a specific date and time.
       
    3. PushNotificationTool: Send immediate push notifications for urgent/critical information.
       - Use for items requiring immediate attention.
    Process each email systematically and use the appropriate tools based on the content.
    Send a pushnotification even if the remainder is set for any matter with date and time. 
    Mails that don't have date and time, send push notifications only.

    IMPORTANT: 1. Do not set multiple reminders for the same event. 2. Only set reminders for tests, quizzes, assignments, exams, and deadlines. 3. Do not set reminders for regular events like meetings, webinars, workshops, internships etc.
